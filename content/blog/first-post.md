Just a quick post about this whole blog thing. The CMS is hosted on [forestry.io](forestry.io). This makes editing the website very simple and easy.  
  
The backend is running on Hugo. Really fast, non bloated simple stuff. The website will probably be hosted on Github pages, but I haven't set that up yet.  
  
Anyways, trying to keep it as simple as possible. I want to be able to help people post their own content on the internet and become their own land lords. But in order to do that, it needs to be extremely easy. So I'll do the work to figure out an easy way for them to get into this. While also letting them have the freedom of hosting and the freedom of owning and choosing where they want their content.
